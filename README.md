## Features
[//]: <> (For a complete list of features please check the mods [official page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-seasons-byg-compat))

## FAQ
**Source?**
This mod is a simple port of [Fabric Seasons: BYG Compat](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-seasons-byg-compat),
So basically all the credit goes out to [D4rkness_King](https://modrinth.com/user/D4rkness_King) for making it.
**Why?**
I wanted to play Biomes Weve Gone with Fabric Seasons, thats it.
**Will you port it to X?**
No, I made this for 1.20.1, the only time I'll consider updating this are:
- I want to play Biomes Weve Gone and Fabric Seasons on a newer version of minecraft, without there being a port.
- I randomly feel like updating it or changing something, which is unlikely.
